## Introduction
This project applies linear regression to an e-commerce dataset to predict a target variable (e.g annual customer spending).
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- `email`: contains email of the customer
- `avatar`: Username of the customer
- `address`: Address of the customer
- Time Spent on App: Time spent by the user on the App before making a purchase
-  Time Spent on Web: Time spent by the user on the Web before making a purchase
-  Length of Membership: The time a customer has been subscribed to the business
-  Yearly amount spent: Annual expenditure of the customer


## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, install the necessary packages using the following command:

pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn


## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdul-5844/Supervised_Learning_Linear_Regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Supervised_Learning_Linear_Regression
    ```
3. Run the linear regression script:
    ```bash
    python ecompred.py
    ```

## Results
The results of the linear regression model, including performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) values, are presented in the results section of the script. Visualizations of the model's performance are also provided.
